# NoSQL-API
Social Network API using a NoSQL Database

# Description
I set out to develop a social networking API that utilizes a NoSQL database. Doing that I was able to create a social network platform that allows a user to add and delete a friend as well as share their own thoughts with others. It stores all of that information in an Object Data Model Library(Mongoose). Using mongoose to enforce the schema gives the database a lot more flexibility. In the future I plan to add the functionality of being able to respond or react to a users thoughts. Besides that everything else is running and functioning as intended.

# Usage

from the command line run `NPM INSTALL` to install all of the dependencies, then `NPM RUN DEV` to start the server with Node/Nodemon(for automatic restarts after changes are made). Once the server is running and listening open the Insomnia. From there you are able to run all of the 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT' and 'DELETE' routes. Below is a list of the programs and packages I used and a link to documentation on all of them.

* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) 
* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
    

# Credits
  
I used information provided in the OSU-VIRT-FSF-PT-08-2023-U-LOLC repo as a guideline on how to create this application. I also utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant and Stack over flow when errors in the Command line errors would pop up.
